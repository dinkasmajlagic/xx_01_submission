Task for the statistician position at the FHI

1) Since I do not have any experience with the time series and forecasting I was not able to finish this task
2) For all the municipalities: 
    I was able to aggregate the data by weeks 
3) For one municipality: 
    I was able to decompose the data and to examine the seasonality and trend 
    I was able to fit the regression model
    I was able to perform the forecasting and to predict the data based on the training data
    
    All the code can be found in Run.R
    I did not save any Excel files nor any plots since I was not able to finish the task
    One can find the code for decomposition plot and forecast plot in Run.R written for one randomly chosen municipality
